# Modi

> (3) Meter Observatory Desktop Interface, a simple gui for controlling the [Sooner Radio Telescope](nhn.ou.edu/srt) built using Electron. This app was based off of the original C code provided by MIT Haystack for their SRT program. The original code was heavily modified and adapted for the OU SRT and has prompted a full rewrite.
